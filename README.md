Here’s a README.md file you can use for your Network Sniffer and Analyzer project:

# Network Sniffer and Analyzer

This is a Python-based **Network Packet Sniffer and Analyzer**. The tool captures network traffic in real-time, analyzes packet details, detects suspicious activity, and generates reports. It supports protocols like TCP, UDP, and ICMP, and can send alerts when unusual traffic patterns are detected.

## Features

- **Real-Time Packet Sniffing**: Capture live network packets.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Analyze TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets with detailed information like source/destination IP, ports, protocol type, and more.
- **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Alerts for suspicious traffic (e.g., traffic from unusual IP addresses).
- **Logging**: Logs detailed information about captured packets.
- **Traffic Report Generation**: Generates simple traffic analysis reports from the logs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Scapy
- PyShark
- SMTP (for email alerts)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/network-sniffer.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd network-sniffer


	3.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage

1. Sniff Network Packets

To start sniffing packets and analyzing network traffic in real-time, run the following command:

python sniffer.py

This will capture and display packets from the network in real-time, logging information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol type, and more. Suspicious activity will trigger alerts.

2. Analyze Traffic

To analyze the traffic captured in the logs, run the following command:

python analyzer.py

This will display a summary of the captured traffic, including counts of different protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP).

3. Generate Traffic Report

To generate a detailed report based on the captured traffic logs, run:

python report_generator.py

The report will summarize the packets captured, their types, and related details.

Alerts

	•	If suspicious traffic is detected (e.g., from an IP address you want to monitor), an alert will be generated.
	•	The alert can be configured to send an email using SMTP. Edit the alerts.py script to provide your email credentials.
